# OpenHSR
## Description
The dataset includes 246 food products from Australian retailers in 2025. Each record contains about 20 variables covering nutrients, metadata, and Health Star Ratings (HSR). It enables analysis of nutritional quality and labeling diversity while following FAIR principles for accessibility and reusability.

- **Nutrient Composition:** Energy (kJ and kcal), protein, total fat, saturated fat, carbohydrates, sugars, fiber, and sodium (per 100 g).  
- **Metadata:** Product name, product type, category, country of origin, retailer, date collected, allergens, ingredients, and data source.  
- **Health Star Rating (HSR):** A score from 0.5 to 5 stars, representing overall nutritional quality.

The dataset is structured to support analysis of nutritional quality, HSR modeling, and food labeling research.

## Data Source
All data were manually collected from Australian retail products in 2025. Efforts were made to ensure accuracy and consistency, including verification against product packaging and standardized variable naming.

## Usage
The dataset can be used for:  
- Nutritional analysis  
- Machine learning models predicting HSR  
- Policy research or consumer behavior studies
